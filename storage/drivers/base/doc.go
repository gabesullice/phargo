/*
Package base provides a number of default implementations of
"github.com/gabesullice/phargo/storage" interfaces. These implementations are
meant to aid in development of new storage drivers.

You may embed those implementations in your storage drivers. See
https://godoc.org/github.com/gabesullice/phargo/storage/drivers/sqlite#Client
for a real example.
